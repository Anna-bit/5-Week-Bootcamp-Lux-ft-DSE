    "In Python, a compound data type is a structure that can store multiple values, possibly of different types, within a single entity. \n",
    "These data types enable you to group related items together and manipulate them as a unit. \n",
    "Python offers several built-in compound data types, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List\n",
    "A list is an ordered collection of items that can include any type, such as integers, strings, or even other lists. \n",
    "Lists are mutable, which means you can change their contents after they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "example_list = [1, 'cup', 3.14, [1, 2, 3]]\n",
    "\n",
    "·  example_list contains an integer, a string, a float, and another list as elements.\n",
    "·  Lists are indexed, so you can access items using their index, e.g., my_list[0] would return '1'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dictionary\n",
    "A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and serves as a reference to its associated value. Dictionaries are mutable, allowing you to add, remove, or modify items as needed.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_dict = {\n",
    "    'name': 'Rose',\n",
    "    'age': 20,\n",
    "    'favorites': {'phone': 'samsung', 'food': 'pizza'}\n",
    "}\n",
    "`my_dict` contains keys 'name', 'age', and 'favorites' with their corresponding values.\n",
    " You can access values using keys, e.g., my_dict['name'] would return 'Rose'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tuple\n",
    "A tuple is similar to a list in that it can hold multiple items of different types, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable. \n",
    "This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Tuples are often used to store collections of heterogeneous data. \n",
    "They are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses ().\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_tuple = (100, 'banana', 4.15, (8, 7))\n",
    "·  `my_tuple` contains an integer, a string, a float, and another tuple as elements.\n",
    "·  Elements can be accessed by index, e.g., my_tuple[3] would return (8,7).\n"
