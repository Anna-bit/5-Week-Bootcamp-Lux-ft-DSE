The Ultimate Guide to Data Analytics: Techniques and Tools
#data #sql #python #jupyter
I decided to take a bold step and join my first-ever data career boot camp organized by LuxDevHQ. It is a 5 week Bootcamp that equips one with hands-on data skills. The bootcamp aims to expose one to a wide variety of data skills in at least 4 fields of specialization.
The 1st week kicked off with the info session where I went through program orientation and I was introduced to the program and taken through whole program expectations.

During this 1st week, I have learnt a lot of things including:

I have a better understanding of data analysis and the various roles in the different fields of specialization including data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, and analytical engineering.

I have been able to install the systems and tools necessary and create the environment that I will be able to practice in. The systems that I have installed include python-anaconda, D-beaver and Power BI.

I registered on kaggle and imported the weather data to work with. Then I installed the python packages(pandas and numpy) necessary to read and load the data into my jupyter notebook and performed several data analysis activities on the dataset.

I developed a working knowledge and I understand how to use SQL to interact with databases and extract data.

Systems and Tools I have learnt to use

D-beaver - Postgresql
Jupyter notebook

Data Analysis techniques conducted

a)Load dataset
b)Filter records by condition
c)Count records by condition
d)Check on missing values
e)Rename columns
f)Calculate summary statistics eg find the mean visibility of a dataset.

I am looking forward to learning more about the data collection techniques during the second week of learning. I want to leverage data analysis skills to improve the customer service experience and implement better customer service strategies.
